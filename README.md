3 params
PokerNowLogParser.exe "14May" "c:\poker" "K-Lo"

1) The date that is appended to the output files the process creates
2) The folder where the output files will go AND where the process expects there to be a "games" folder with csv log files. So in case of above the log files should be stored in c:\poker\games
3) Your game name. It will use this to generate things like the worst loss hands report.
